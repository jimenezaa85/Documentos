TO-DO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything looks good, logs are green, but I believe you are missing SXA SOLR cores
1.7.1 introduced optimized SXA indexes and they're not installed through the package of course
So would be nice to add those to SIF as well
can add them to the SOLR core setup
and then we need to patch some config after SXA was installed, either we add a config patch or we have SIF do the modification

-Solr cores are missings
-SXA solr cores 1.7.1 introduced optimized SXA indexes que no son instalados a traves del paquete
Añadirlos a la instalacion de SOLR
Necesito añadir patch

I see there's solr cores missing from SXA 
and I think we need to include a task in the SIF to enable the app pool users to read/write counters

Hi,
My name is Alberto,
I need to learn English. I have a basic level.
I can teach you Spanish
are you interested?
can we exchange language?

https://lanxess.com/

What we are doing in the project?
Step 1 - We are rebulding an intranet environment
Step 2 - We will be building the internet environment

The content of intranet is mainly chemical news and products descriptions

The other supplier was making a lot of mistakes, 
They took a long time for minor changes
Also for updates they changed a lot of money.
That is how Lanxess found out something was wrong
There was a lot of code that was built in such a way that it could only be changed by the
supplier.

So they were very dependant on them.

That is why they asked Cognizant to rebuild everything accoding to Sitecore specifics and to not
implement any of the other platforms


do you know what are the bussines goals?
why they decided to use Sitecore instead of other CMS?
